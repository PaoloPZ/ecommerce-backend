# üõí E-commerce Backend

This is a backend API built as part of a technical challenge. It was developed with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MySQL**, and **Docker**, applying clean architecture and API key authentication. The service includes automatic database population for test cases and is ready to run in a containerized environment.

## üöÄ Features

- üßæ Product management (CRUD)
- üîê API Key authentication
- üê≥ Docker-based development environment
- üß™ Auto-populated database with seed data
- üß∞ Sequelize ORM + MySQL
- üß™ Includes Postman collections for testing

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### 1. Run the project with Docker

Make sure Docker is installed and run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:
- Build the application image
- Start the MySQL container

## üß™ Postman Testing

Postman collections are provided in two formats:
- `postman_collection_v2.json`
- `postman_collection_v2.1.json`

### API Key Authentication

To use the API securely, follow these steps in Postman:

1. Go to the **Authorization** tab  
2. Select **API Key** as Auth Type  
3. Set `Key` to `x-api-key`  
4. Set `Value` using the `ECOMMERCE_API_KEY` from your `.env` file

In your `.env` file:

```env
ECOMMERCE_API_KEY=your_api_key
...
```

## üß¨ Database Layer

The app uses **Sequelize ORM** with **MySQL**. All entities and relationships were created and mapped accordingly, including:
